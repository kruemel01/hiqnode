# HiQnode

Aim: meter bride for Si Expression

## What should it do?

- Provide a HiQnet device to the network ?
- Be able to interpret UDP and TCP parameter streams
- HiQnet packet builder

Maybe include a second package hiqnode-display for easy
display of parameters, with ui elements.
Maybe as client side lib?
