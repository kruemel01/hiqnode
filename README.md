# HiQnode

This is a *node.js* interface for the Harman Professional HiQnet protocol.
Please note that this library is at this moment in very early development, and not even a 
library yet. Be warned: it may blow up in your face spectacularly.

# Why?
I need a big meter bridge for the Si Expression digital console. Unfortunately the board itself
has no monitor output, and so I decided to start work on an interpreter for the protocol
so I could create my own. 

Obviously I don't take any responsibility for damage to you, your HiQnet product or any damage
caused by this software. You have been warned.
